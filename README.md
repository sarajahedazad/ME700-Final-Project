# ME700-Final-Project

I am work shppoing my ideas here!  
I can use this project as an opportunity to really organize my own reseach.

**What do I wanna add to my project?** 
- simple column vs theory --> different meshes
- 2D matrix structural analysis vs fenics -> different meshes
  or now do it for symmetric structures. Do everything for symmetric ones.
if I have the time, I have to add the asymmetric ones

***Documentation***
- Theory  
Maybe I can take this time to understand the concepts better? (this might take like 6 hours)
(2 hours for theory, 2 hour sfor reviewing fem and all, 2 hours for the code)
- Actually learn the kind of chnages to MSA (2-3)
- How to run codes documentation (2 hrs)   

- Mesh generation clenaning (2 hr)
- Functions cleaning (2 hr) 
- Automation tools in one place (2 hr)

6-3-8  

**Skills Used**   
ADD THE SKILLS YOU USED IN THIS PROJECT HERE

**Reproducibility**   
ADD REPRODUCIBILITY   

**A protocol that we can really really trust**
